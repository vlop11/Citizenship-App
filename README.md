# Citizenship App

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
This is an iOS app created to help Spanish speakers study for the U.S. Citizenship civis test -- Designed specifically for my mom, therefore specific to GA - 9 district

**So far the app can only function as a flash card type app, but I'm planning on expanding its capabilities
